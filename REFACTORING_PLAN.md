# Profile Page Enhancement Plan

## Overview
Comprehensive refactoring to implement midnight blue and off-white color scheme with enhanced React functionality and improved content.

## Analysis Summary
Current codebase uses:
- React with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables

## Critical Issues Fixed ✅

### ✅ Color Scheme Display Issues
**Problem**: Site was showing brown/pink colors in dark mode and white text on white background in light mode.

**Root Causes Identified:**
1. App.css file had conflicting styles with hardcoded colors and #root styling
2. Theme toggle initialization was inconsistent
3. CSS variable values needed adjustment for proper contrast

**Solutions Implemented:**
1. **Removed App.css conflicts**: Cleared all default styles that were overriding theme variables
2. **Fixed CSS Variables**: 
   - Light mode: Off-white background (248 248 255) with midnight blue text (25 25 112)
   - Dark mode: Midnight blue background (25 25 112) with off-white text (248 248 255)
3. **Enhanced Theme Toggle**: Improved initialization logic and class application
4. **Proper Class Management**: Ensured dark/light classes are correctly applied to document element

**Final Result**: Clean midnight blue and off-white color scheme with fully functional light/dark mode toggle.

## Technical Summary
- ✅ All original features implemented successfully
- ✅ Color scheme issues completely resolved
- ✅ Theme toggle working properly
- ✅ No build errors or critical warnings
- ✅ Clean, maintainable codebase
- ✅ Responsive design maintained
- ✅ Accessibility standards met
